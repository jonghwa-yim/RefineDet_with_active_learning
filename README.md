# RefineDet_with_active_learning
Bayesian Dropout is applied to Object Detector, RefineDet, for active learning

# Basic Setting
follow the guide in https://github.com/sfzhang15/RefineDet

# Active learning
Refer allinone_create_new_trainval.py and test_refinedet/refinedet_run_bayesianNN.py
Run allinone_create_new_trainval.py to iteratively increase training set and test accuracy, which is active learning.
